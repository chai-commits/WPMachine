# WPMachine

WPMachine is a website application that measures your WPM (Words Per Minute) and your typing accuracy.

## How it works

You will be presented with a group of words/sentences/paragraphs which you must type out. As soon as you start typing, the timer will start.

The characters you type correctly will be highlighted green and the characters you type incorrectly will be highlighted red.

If you type a character incorrectly, you are allowed to backspace and retry the character. You cannot type two consecutive characters incorrectly.

Once you have finished typing out all of the characters, the timer will stop, and your WPM and accuracy will be calculated and presented to you. You will also be presented with an overall rating of your performance.

## Calculation

### WPM

WPM is calculated by dividing the total number of words by the number of minutes taken. For e.g. if you type 200 words in 5 minutes, your WPM is 40.

### Accuracy

Accuracy is calculated by dividing the total number of correct characters typed by the total number of characters typed. For e.g. if you type 90 characters correctly out of 100 total characters, your accuracy is 90%.
